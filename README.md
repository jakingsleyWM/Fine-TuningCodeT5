# Fine-Tuning CodeT5 for Predicting `if` Statements in Python

This project fine-tunes the [`Salesforce/codet5-small`](https://huggingface.co/Salesforce/codet5-small) model to predict missing `if` conditions in Python functions. 

# How to Run

1. Clone repository (https://github.com/jakingsleyWM/Fine-TuningCodeT5.git).
2. Open Assignment.pynb in a Python environment such as Google CoLab or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Make sure the datasets ['ft_test.csv'], ['ft_train.csv'], and ['ft_valid.csv'] are in the runtime filespace.
4. Run the code blocks.
5. Access individual results in ['testset-results.csv'], or access averaged results in the final code cell output.
